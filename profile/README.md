## Plot and Themes
The narrative structure of "Better Man" follows a nonlinear format, weaving between the milestones of Robbie Williams' career and the personal struggles that defined him. The film chronicles Williams‚Äô humble beginnings in Stoke-on-Trent, his rise to fame as part of Take That, and the tumultuous transition to a solo career. The overarching theme of the movie is Williams‚Äô battle with inner demons, including addiction and mental health issues, while exploring the pressures of fame and the quest for identity.

One of the boldest narrative decisions in "Better Man" is the representation of Robbie Williams as an anthropomorphic chimpanzee. This creative choice, symbolic of his feelings of being ‚Äúless evolved‚Äù or out of place in the highly competitive music industry, sets the film apart from traditional biopics. It‚Äôs a metaphor for his self-perception and the disconnect he often felt in his personal and professional life.

The film is filled with poignant moments, where the juxtaposition of Williams' public persona against his private struggles is beautifully portrayed.

The cinematography is another highlight, with the film‚Äôs vibrant color palette shifting to darker tones during Williams‚Äô moments of despair. The seamless integration of CGI to bring the chimpanzee metaphor to life is a testament to Gracey‚Äôs commitment to storytelling innovation. The motion capture performance by Jonno Davies, paired with Williams‚Äô own voiceovers, adds depth and emotion to the character.
